# file: pam_xos.conf
# configuration file for XtreemOS PAM module
# Support PAM version >= 0.4


##############################################################
# * Shared buffer for PAM hooks
#
# In some cases, PAM hooks are called by different threads.
# For efficient passing data between hooks, uncomment the
# UseShareBuffer and set the option to yes. 
#UseShareBuffer		no


#############################################################
# * Debug support
#
# The debug mode will print debug information for tracking
# running. Uncomment the UseDebug to show the running 
# information.
#UseDebug		no


#############################################################
# * System log  support
#
# The log mode will save the debug information to syslog.
#UseSyslog		no

#############################################################
# * Automount support
#
# XtreemFS has provided powerful data storage in distributed
# environment. If user want to use his/her home volume in 
# global XtreemFS, he/she can mount the volume to local
# home directory. Opening the option will help the work be 
# done by transparently. 
#OpenAutoMount		yes

###########################################################
# * Stable mapping support
#
# The parameters told PAM, whether uid/gid for given user's
# credentials are removed after session closes. Set 'yes'
# if administrator want to keep reuse of previous uid/gid,
# and 'no' will ask PAM removes the temporary uid/gid 
# completelyi. For those uid/gid which are not active for
# 6 monthes, they will be cleared by AMS, through the
# 'yes' is set in this section.
# 
#
#FixedIDAlloc		no


###########################################################
# * External authentication servie (not available)
#
# Authentication by myproxy 
# The section will provide an optional authentication
# via MyProxy. The configuration here will
# provide necessary parameters to connection.
#
# MyProxy		yes/no
#	ProxyServer	<My ProxyServer IP address>
#	ProxyServerPort	<Port>
#
# * ProxyServer: the IP address of MyProxy server
# * ProxyServerPort: the port of server
#
#
# MyProxy               no
#       ProxyServer     http://192.168.9.11
#       ProxyServerPort 4334


###########################################################
# * AMS configuration
#
# At default, AMS will reside in same node with PAM module,
# so the configuration will be set as:
#
# UseExternalAMS          yes/no
#         AMSServerIsLocal yes/no
#         AMSServer       <AMS server IP address>
#         AMSPort         <port>
#
# For cluster, some nodes may use one trusted AMS, so the
# AMS must be located in one of node, holding its IP and
# port, and other nodes can set its trusted AMS's IP and 
# port to the node.
#
# * AMSServerIsLocal:  for security, local AMS may choose
#   permission-check UNIX socket for communication, which
#   will check the socket permission.
# * AMSServer: IP address of AMS server
# * AMSPort: port of AMS server
#
UseExternalAMS		yes
        AMSServerIsLocal no
	AMSServer	localhost
	AMSPort		8000


#########################################################
# * External Access Controll support (not available)
#
# AES configuration 
# The section of Access Enforcement Service (AES) provides
# third part support for access control and quota information.
#
# The parameters:
# UseExternalAES	yes/no
#	AESServer	<IP address>
#	AESPort		<port number>
#
#
# * AESServer: IP address for AES
# * AESPort: port number for AES
#
# UseExternalAES        no
#       AESServer       localhost
#       AESPort         8000


########################################################
# * local resource policy
#
# resource quota limitation for local administrator
# Beside the policy rule defined in AMS, local
# administrator is also provided the simple text-based
# configuration for quota limiation. The template is
# located in /etc/xos/mapdata/quota.conf.
#
#VOACConf		/etc/xos/mapdata/quota.conf


#########################################################
# * trusted CA 
#
# The location of trusted CA root certificate.
# The CA certificate will be used to authenticated and
# authorized user's identity.
#
# * VOCACertDir: specify the location of root certificate
# * VOCACertFile: specifiy the name of root certificate
#

VOCACertDir 		/etc/xos/truststore/certs
VOCACertFile		xtreemos.crt


########################################################
# * cgroup support (EXPERIMENTIAL)
#
# From kernel 2.6.27, cgroup and container have been
# embedded in to support virtualization. Both facilities
# can also be used in resource management and behavior
# control of process.
#
# The option here is used to open the cgroup support
# to control process behavior. Also, subsystems should be
# presented explicitly in option, or only "memory" would
# be mounted. As for resource control, it needs to be 
# patched the kernel.
#
# At default, the kernel (2.6.27+) may carry the subsystems
# of cpu and memory which are in mainstream. So, we put
# them here as default subsystems to be mounted. As for
# XtreemOS-related subsystem such as "disk", it has to be
# patched kernel. The patch would be commited later.
#
# UseCgroups		no
#    Subsystems		cpuacct,memory
